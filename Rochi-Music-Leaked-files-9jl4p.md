Rochi Music has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality. In 2015, Rochi Music expanded her online presence by creating a YouTube channel. She began posting vlogs, comedy skits, and gaming content, which quickly gained traction. Her unique blend of humor, authenticity, and vulnerability resonated with viewers, leading to a steady growth in her subscriber base.
